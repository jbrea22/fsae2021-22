This is an ongoing project that consumes a REST API in ReactJS by using Axios, a helpful library. In this dashboard UI, Axios is used to pull specific data from a JSON file. The JSON file is located via IP address, in this case, the IP address of our CAN bus data logger. Then, the data is displayed in the form of gauges, charts, tables, and plain text. The project is temporarily using dummy JSON data from https://mocki.io/v1/b771bbea-0568-4fc9-bf06-1a0c9470cca1 because our car is still in physical development, therefore there's no real car data available to extract and display. The project successfully extracts and displays data from the dummy JSON link.

This project started in October 2021 and is expected to be completed before June 2022 for the Formula SAE Competiton in Brooklyn, MI. Throughout the entire process, I've built this dashboard UI independently.
